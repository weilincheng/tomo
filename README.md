## :hammer_and_pick: Tech Stack

**Client:** JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap

**Server:** Node.js, Express, MySQL, Redis

**Cloud Services:** AWS EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, S3, CloudFront

**CI/CD:** AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy

**Testing:** Mocha, Chai

**Others:** Socket.IO, Google Maps API

## :classical_building: System Structure

- Orchestrated CI/CD flow using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.
- Kept server stateless by reorganizing MySQL, Redis, and static assets to AWS RDS, ElastiCache, and S3.

## :round_pushpin: How to render tens of thousands of markers in milliseconds?

Without any optimization, it might take minutes to render 10k markers on Google Maps. Below are the two optimizations used in Tomo to improve the rendering time.

### Optimization 1: Only renders markers within the visible range

- Since the visible range of maps is limited, it is enough to just render markers that are within the visible range.
- But what if the currently visible range is large that we still need to render many markers? Thatâ€™s why we need the second optimization.

### Optimization 2: Aggregates markers into clusters by the k-means clustering algorithm

- When there are numerous markers on the map, instead of rendering each marker individually, we can render a clustering marker to represent a group of markers. There are two advantages:
  - Keep the information on the map simple and easy to understand
  - Reduce the number of markers we need to render
- After the aggregation on the server side, the client side only receives aggregated clustering markers that carry a number to indicate the number of markers. Assuming we aggregate 10k markers into 10 groups, the number of markers we need to render is 1000 times less.

### Flow

## :books: How to use it?

1. Clone the project

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:weilincheng/tomo.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory and install NPM dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Refer to `.env.template` to create a `.env` file under root directory

4. Run the below command to start the server

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

5. Use browser to open the localhost path `http://localhost:8080` (You can set the port number in `.env`)
